/**
 * Keep the embedding page's iframe the same height as the calculator.
 *
 * Every Local Threads page that carries the calculator pins the iframe to a
 * fixed height (760px on the homepage, a 780px min-height on the city and
 * service pages) while the card itself runs roughly 430-500px and changes with
 * the slide. The leftover few hundred pixels render as dead charcoal under the
 * card on ~110 pages.
 *
 * A frame cannot resize itself, so the height goes over postMessage and the
 * parent applies it. Two things have to happen together or the number is wrong:
 *
 *  - `.slide-container` has `min-height: 100vh` and `.slide-page` has
 *    `max-height: calc(100vh - 48px)`. Inside a frame, 100vh is the frame's own
 *    height, so measuring would just hand back whatever height the parent
 *    already set. The `is-embedded` class drops both.
 *  - Dropping the max-height also breaks a feedback loop. Left in, the parent
 *    shrinking the frame would shrink 100vh, which would clamp the card, which
 *    would report smaller again.
